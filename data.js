            "Like any milestone birthday, the 80th anniversary of the creation of the Bretton Woods institutions, which include the World Bank and its sister organization the International Monetary Fund (IMF), offers an opportunity to reflect on how much the world has changed since these two institutions were created in 1944—and how much the institutions have evolved to meet those changes.",


            "Over the last eight decades, the world has transformed itself radically with an unprecedented reduction in poverty and improvement in the lives of billions of people. At the same time, many challenges, ranging from fragility and violence, widespread famine, climate-related impacts, and a pandemic, have confronted countries and reversed years of progress.",


            "These opportunities and challenges require the World Bank Group to constantly adjust, adapt and change. This mindset is continuing today.",


            "One example of that evolution is our work to renew our approach to knowledge. As part of this, we are launching the World Bank Group (WBG) Academy. The WBG Academy is a new global knowledge platform that seeks enhanced engagement among World Bank staff, development practitioners, government officials, think tanks and other partners, to learn from our experiences, share knowledge and discuss options to difficult development challenges. A unified platform for institutions that make up the World Bank Group—the World Bank, International Finance Corporation, and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency—the Academy is part of our broader efforts to transform our approach to knowledge to better identify the solutions needed to meet today's top concerns. It is also a direct response to clients' calls for us to make capacity development a core service, along with financing and analytics.",


            " Research and experience have shown that a lack of client capacity can be nearly as much of a constraint as inadequate financing when it comes to achieving development objectives. Battling multiple crises, our clients are asking for help in designing and implementing policies, reforms, and development programs to address a broad spectrum of issues: climate change, digital development, energy access and transition, food security, fragility, jobs, pandemic prevention, and preparedness, and much more. The Academy builds on the World Bank Group's 80 years of experience and capitalizes on its ready access to knowledge and expertise from around the world. Today's global challenges require an innovative approach, one that uses the world's best development knowledge to help craft the best workable solutions.",


            " The Academy launches in multiple locations this month with an initial series of 17 programs targeting policy makers, government officials, and development practitioners. This rollout will continue throughout 2024, and we will follow up with an expanded program starting next year. All programs are grounded in analytical work coming out of the World Bank's research department and the knowledge verticals - People, Planet, Prosperity, Infrastructure, and Digital - as well as capturing knowledge from the private sector arms of the World Bank Group.",


            " The Academy programs seek to put our engagement at a new level, working directly across the globe and ensuring that the latest insights on development—at a global, regional, and country levels—can be readily shared and integrated into World Bank Group operations.",


            " This engagement will be delivered in a variety of formats, from global seminars and workshops to peer-to-peer events, and through facilitating practical e-learning courses and new courses on emerging topics. Our goal is for the WBG Academy to help sharpen the focus and approaches towards achieving development outcomes, as outlined by the Sustainable Development Goals, and in a quicker and more impactful way.",


            " The Academy is about continuous learning, continuous adjustment, and continuously seeking the best development outcomes. The World Bank Group is giving a renewed focus to our 80-year learning tradition and elevating knowledge to 21st century learning and exchange, tapping into the latest technology and using new methodologies to maximize reach and scale. The Academy will boost countries' abilities to carry out effective development policies, help countries achieve their development ambitions, and build a better future for their people."

            "Not long ago, I challenged a group of young people to reflect on the development progress achieved so far. And to look at current challenges with the same sense of resolve. I did the same, with optimism and confidence in the World Bank Group's ability to step up and do even more.",


            "When it comes to improving people's lives, there's always more to be done. More impact to have. More lives to transform.",


            "In today's troubled world, achieving results is imperative. More than ever, development results—as well as capturing lessons and trends in what works — is what should drive us. Only then can we track our progress toward our ultimate goal: a world free of poverty on a livable planet.",


            "This is the journey we're on, driven by outcomes and evidence. Measuring our results is a cornerstone of our work to become more transparent, accountable, and deliver impact that changes lives. Through our new World Bank Group scorecard, we will get a better sense of how we are doing, where we are going, and where we want to be.",


            "Today, we're releasing the first 11 of 22 indicators, from how many students have benefited from better education to how many people are using broadband internet to how many people got access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene.",


            "More than numbers, these are critical indicators to inform our strategies, enhance transparency, help us identify gaps, and enrich our dialogue with country and partners. They offer us an opportunity to assess the relevance of our priorities at the country level, supporting clients on how to make the best choices and investments for people.",


            "It's a work in progress and only reflects part of our total portfolio. Later this year, we will share the data for the full set of the remaining indicators, and we will continue to refine our methodologies and gather more and better data.",


            "The scorecard is transforming the way we measure outcomes. By unifying data from the World Bank, International Finance Corporation, and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, we amplify our collective strength. Together, we can better target public sector interventions, pinpoint transformative private investments, and identify where risk mitigation will unlock critical projects.",


            "Take food security: To date, the data captured in our active portfolio has helped feed 156 million people*. Roughly 50 percent of them live in countries affected by conflict and fragility, where help is most needed. And nearly half of all the people we help are women and girls.",


            "But are we doing enough? Look at Africa, for instance. Our portfolio supports almost a quarter of Africa's food insecure population. While this is significant, we must redouble efforts to mobilize the private sector and development partners and deploy our knowledge more effectively to scale up our impact.",


            "Or take education: Preliminary data show that our active portfolio has improved schooling for 280 million students*, including 137 million women and girls. At the same time, 7 in 10 children in low- and middle-income countries still experience learning poverty, numbers that could be even drastically higher if we take the share of children who can read at a minimum level. This is our opportunity to tackle learning poverty where it is the highest. We know that policymakers with better information on the levels of learning poverty tend to prioritize literacy and support to students.",


            "These examples offer just a few of the provisional insights from our new scorecard. But the story is not complete yet. This is just the start, and our data will become firmer over time.",


            "My takeaway is clear: It's time for all of us to double down on transparency and accountability for results, learning from what works and what doesn't, and adjusting as we go together on this journey."

        'date': "JUNE 26, 2024",
        'img': "./images/Worker-WB-Pic_750x422.webp",
        'para': [
            "The World Bank's latest Migration and Development Brief shows that officially recorded remittances to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) reached an estimated $656 billion in 2023. The true size of remittances, including flows through informal channels, is even larger. That said, the growth rate of remittances in last year was only 0.7%, significantly lower than 10.8% and 8.3% registered in 2021 and 2022, respectively (figure 1). And yet, remittances outpaced FDI and ODA.",


            "By region, remittance flows to Latin America and the Caribbean saw the highest increase, at 7.7 percent. In contrast, Remittances to the Middle East and Africa dropped by nearly 15 percent, primarily due to reduced flows to Egypt. Flows to Europe and Central Asia fell by 10 percent, mainly stemming from diminished transfers from Russia to neighboring countries. The value of outward remittance flows from Russia were impacted by a weak ruble against the US dollar.",


            "The high-level drivers of the regional trends are: (a) Strong labor markets in the advanced economies, particularly in the United States, the largest source country for remittances and the primary destination for migrants globally; (b) Weaker oil prices impacted outward remittances from the GCC countries and from Russia. (c) Exchange rates impacted remittances from Russia due to valuation effects of a weaker ruble/US$; and flows to Egypt, Nigeria and Ethiopia were impacted by multiple exchange rates, a result of balance of payments difficulties facing these nations. (d) War and conflicts also impacted flows, especially through formal channels. Regulations relating to combating money laundering and financing of terrorism were tightened in many corridors. Indeed, in the ECA region, the cost of sending money was higher in 2023 Q4 than in 2022 Q4.",


            "The slowdown in remittance flows in 2023 reflects a return to more normal growth after the post-pandemic surge in 2021 and 2022. Growth is expected to pick up in 2024 and 2025. By 2025, remittances to LMICs are expected to reach $690 billion.",


            "It is notable that despite a growth slowdown, remittances outpaced FDI and ODA (figure 2). The gap between remittances and FDI is expected to widen further in the coming years. During the past decade, remittances increased by 55 percent, while FDI declined by 48 percent (see MIGA report). The gap between remittances and ODA is also expected to widen in the coming years. Remittances will likely continue to increase because of enormous migration pressures driven by demographic trends, income gaps, and climate change.",


            "This is not to suggest that remittances could substitute for FDI or ODA. Developing countries need FDI, especially in critical infrastructure and green investments. They also need ODA to address public financing needs and externalities such as fragility and climate change. Instead, countries need to take note of the size and resilience of remittances and find ways to leverage these flows for poverty reduction, financing health and education, financial inclusion of households, and improving access to capital markets for state and nonstate enterprises.",


            "Sending remittances remains too costly due to limited competition among providers and inadequate cross-border inter-operability. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the global average cost for sending $200 was 6.4 percent of the amount being sent, slightly up from 6.2 percent a year earlier and well above the Sustainable Development Goal target of 3 percent. Sending money to Sub-Saharan Africa was nearly 8 percent.",


            "Fees charged to senders (and sometimes recipients) are often masked by nontransparent FX markups. In many countries with multiple exchange rates, remittances tend to flow through unregulated channels. In such cases, the foreign currency may not even flow across borders, thus, depriving the recipient country access to foreign exchange. The problem is acute in countries facing fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS).",


            "In a recent panel discussion organized by MIGA ahead of the International Day of Family Remittances, some leading market players addressed the question of how MDBs can help reduce remittance costs and encourage more flows through formal channels. The panelists proposed the creation of a Private Sector Working Group to look into promoting competition and inclusive partnerships, reducing FX markups, promoting interoperability of technology and standardization, simplification and harmonization of regulations including ID requirements, and improving financial literacy.",


            "To the extent that political risks - such as expropriation, restrictions on currency transfer and convertibility, expropriation, and breach of contract - are constraining investments in the remittances and payments sector, MIGA and other MDBs can provide guarantee to mitigate such risks. Money transfer operators trying to scale up operations in developing countries, or considering investments in FCS countries can take advantage of such guarantees. There may be a need for such cover also in the case of working capital required by MTOs for pre-funding transactions. And countries or enterprises considering investment mobilization through diaspora bonds or diaspora funds could also take advantage of political risk insurance."

        'para': [
            "The World Bank Group assigns the world's economies[1] to four income groups - low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high. The classifications are updated each year on July 1, based on the GNI per capita of the previous calendar year. GNI measures are expressed in United States dollars[2] using conversion factors derived according to the Atlas method, which in its current form was introduced in 1989[3]. The World Bank's income classification aims to reflect a country's level of development, drawing on Atlas GNI per capita as a broadly available indicator of economic capacity.",


            "The classification of countries into income categories has evolved significantly over the period since the late 1980s. In 1987, 30% of reporting countries were classified as low income, while in 2022 only 12% fell into this category.  The extent of this decline is different between world regions, with the Sub-Saharan African region's proportion of low-income countries falling from 74% to 46% in 2022, East Asia Pacific from 26% to 3%, and South Asia from 100% to 13% as economies moved to higher categories over this period. This is depicted visually in the diagram below, which shows the income patterns by region.",


            "The updated country income classifications for FY24, based on the GNI per capita of 2022, are available here.",


            "From a statistical perspective, classifications can change for two reasons:",


            "Changes to Atlas GNI per capita: In each country, factors such as economic growth, inflation, exchange rates, and population growth can all influence the level of Atlas GNI per capita. Revisions to improve methods and data can also have an impact. Updated data on Atlas GNI per capita for 2022 can be accessed here.",


            "Changes to classification thresholds: To keep income classification thresholds fixed in real terms, they are adjusted annually for inflation using the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) deflator, a weighted average of the GDP deflators of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Euro Area.",


            "Not surprisingly, of countries changing income categories in 2022, virtually all moved to a higher category as the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continued. In terms of Atlas GNI per capita, roughly 80% of countries showed improvement in 2022 vis-à-vis the pre-pandemic period (2019).",


            "Both Guyana and American Samoa are moving from upper-middle to the high income category this year. The large increase in Guyana's Atlas GNI per capita is driven by the increasing volume of oil and gas production which more than doubled in 2022. The nominal increase was further amplified by higher oil and gas prices, and despite strong increases in outflows of primary income abroad, Guyana's nominal GNI jumped 86.2% leading to a 60.0% increase in Atlas GNI per capita. In American Samoa the increase in Atlas GNI per capita in 2022 was mainly due to a substantial downward revision (-18.3%) to population estimates by the United Nations Population Division, reflecting new available data from the 2020 census.",


            "El Salvador, Indonesia, and West Bank and Gaza all had Atlas GNI very close to the upper-middle income threshold in 2021, so modest GDP growth in 2022 was enough to bring these economies into this category. The Salvadorean economy saw 2.6% real GDP growth, while Indonesia continued its strong post pandemic recovery and real GDP increased 5.3%. Following strong post-pandemic growth in 2021 (7.9%), 3.9% growth in 2022 was sufficient for West Bank and Gaza to cross the threshold into the upper-middle income category.",


            "Guinea and Zambia both moved from the low income to the lower-middle income category this year. Despite political instability and supply disruptions in agriculture, the Guinea economy grew 4.7% in 2022, boosted by a strong mining sector. Zambia's economy grew 4.7% in 2022, combined with 8.6% inflation (measured by the GDP deflator), which led nominal GNI to increase by 17.7% and Atlas GNI per capita by 13.6%.",


            "Jordan was the only country with a downward classification change this year, mainly the result of a large upward revision (+8.6%) to population estimates published by the United Nations Population Division reflecting new data from the latest population census."

            "Recent technological innovations in the transport sector are breathtaking: Global electric car sales went from almost none in 2010 to 13 million in 2023. In many places, door-to-door transport services spanning multiple modes are available within mere minutes after a simple swipe of your finger on a smartphone screen, be it for a passenger or a parcel. And yet, significant challenges still lay ahead for the transport sector to reduce its climate impact and to bring the benefits of transformative technologies to more people worldwide. Transformative technologies - ones that truly shift the paradigm and make the impossible possible - are putting effective solutions within closer reach.",


            "Transport currently accounts for almost a quarter of direct CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. But recent innovations have enabled new mobility services and business models that could significantly reduce the sector's footprint. Shared mobility solutions, for instance—such as carshare, bikeshare, etc.—would not be possible without the wide use of smartphones and ubiquitous access to wireless data. Likewise, the modern green logistics system heavily depends on the digitization of transactions and the seamless tracking of freight.",


            "More broadly, the convergence of technological innovations in digital connectivity, data platforms, automation, and alternative energy has the potential to transform the sector in a fundamental way, making transport not only more efficient but also greener, safer, and more inclusive.",


            "Before these benefits can materialize, however, there are a number of critical questions that need to be addressed: What makes a technology innovation transformational? How to harness the most benefits and mitigate potential negative impacts? What are the roles of the public and private sectors in technology adoption? How can we make these solutions relevant to the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)?",


            "So far, this latest wave of technological innovations has happened mostly in advanced economies, although exciting examples are also emerging across the developing world. A World Bank study on the electrification of Shenzhen's entire bus fleet shows that an electric bus in China emits 37.56% fewer greenhouse gas emissions across its entire lifecycle compared to an equivalent diesel vehicle. By gradually replacing traditional paper-based driving licenses with a smart chip-embedded card, Kenya has reduced the wait for applying for a driver's license from six months to a few days, increased the reliability of the driver's license service, and improved the management and security of its transport system. The social benefits were particularly visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Sahel region, the Bank analyzed the potential for electrification of two- and three-wheelers, which play a vital role in public transport in Mali and Burkina Faso. In Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, the electronic tolling introduce user-pay principles along the corridor and become an important sustainability component of the regional connectivity and development project.",


            "The World Bank, through its expertise and global reach, has a critical role to play. It can effectively support developing countries in capitalizing on leapfrog opportunities for digitalization and asset management, integrating digital technology deployment with Intelligent Transportation Systems innovations, embracing electric mobility, and ultimately driving sustainable development in the transport sector.",


            "We hope this work can shine a light on the transformative potential of technology and help policymakers navigate the quickly changing landscape of transport innovation. Although different countries may need to prioritize different solutions based on the local context, one thing is for certain: no matter where you live, technology is bound to have a profound impact on the way you move. With the right tools and policies in place, this provides a rare opportunity to make transport better, greener, and smarter."

            "Global poverty estimates were updated today on the Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP). As explained in more detail in the What's New document, more than 100 new surveys were added to the PIP database, bringing the total number of surveys to more than 2,300. With more recent survey data, this March 2024 PIP update is the first to report a global poverty number for 2020-2022, the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimate that COVID-19 increased extreme poverty in the world, as measured by the international poverty line of $2.15, from 8.9 percent in 2019 to 9.7 percent in 2020 (see Figure 1). This is the first increase in global poverty in decades. It is in line with earlier estimates of the COVID-19 impact which used limited survey data and GDP growth projections.",


            "The global increase in extreme poverty in 2020 is driven by South Asia, where extreme poverty increased by 2.4 percentage points to 13 percent between 2019 and 2020. In Latin America and the Caribbean, however, extreme poverty continued to decline in 2020, which is driven by Brazil. This can be explained by the role of fiscal policy in mitigating the economic impacts of the COVID-19 shock. At a higher poverty line of $3.65 (the poverty line more relevant for assessing poverty in lower-middle-income countries), poverty also fell in Latin America and the Caribbean and in East Asia and the Pacific even in 2020. At $6.85 (the poverty line more relevant for assessing poverty in upper-middle-income countries), poverty also declined in 2020 in Europe and Central Asia and in advanced countries (“Other High Income”). Unfortunately, survey coverage during the post-2019 period is still limited in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa, so we cannot report poverty estimates beyond 2019 for these regions.",


            "That extreme poverty levels were lower in 2022 relative to 2019 for more prosperous regions, but not for the world, suggests that the economic recovery from the pandemic was uneven and slower for Sub-Saharan Africa where more than half of the extreme poor live. The year 2022 also came with another global shock - Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which contributed to rising inflation in low-, middle- and high-income countries. At the $3.65 and $6.85 poverty lines, the global poverty rate in 2022 are lower the levels recorded in 2019. This result is consistent with the recovery being faster in more prosperous regions, considering that Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for a smaller share of the global poor at these higher lines compared to the extreme poverty line.",


            "This March 2024 global poverty update from the World Bank incorporates updated CPI, national accounts and population data, and revises previously published global and regional estimates from 1981 to 2022. The methodology used for lining up regional and global poverty has also been revised, which leads to small changes. For more details, see the What's New document. Figure 1 shows global and regional poverty trends at all three global absolute poverty lines of the World Bank (see the poverty series using 2011 PPPs here.) Table 1 summarizes the revisions to the regional and global poverty estimates between the September 2023 data vintage and the March 2024 data vintage for the 2019 reference year at all three poverty lines."

Yet, even when deployed in pursuit of legitimate goals, subsidies can harm trading partners, fuel tensions, and provoke countermeasures. They can nullify the benefits of global trade and investment by distorting international prices and limiting market access, as in the case of local content requirements, and they can create inefficiencies in global value chains.",


            "The new database identifies government subsidy programs with stated environmental objectives by sector and compares data for 2022 and 2018. It shows that among green subsidies, priorities are evolving toward programs that support innovation related to green technologies and clean energy goals, such as faster adoption of renewable fuels. China and the United States deploy the largest number of subsidy programs, followed by Australia, Canada, and the European Union. All are large trading economies that have the potential to influence global markets. Most programs are offered by sub-central governments, such as states and provinces.",


            "Ambitious climate objectives, market failures, and existing incentives that favor fossil fuel use can justify greater use of green subsidies. Yet there is a risk that some types of subsidies could distort trade or have effects that limit the free flows of goods, services, and technologies that are needed not only to fight climate change but also to reduce poverty.",


            "The World Bank will continue to track these measures as it seeks to increase transparency, deepen analysis on their nature and economic effects, and foster informed discussions among countries on the appropriate use and design of government subsidies."

            "“All for Health and Health for All.” With this rallying cry of the 77th World Health Assembly still ringing in our ears, now is an apt time to ask where our collective efforts could benefit from new approaches.",


            "Improving global health is a formidable challenge. The latest World Health Organization/World Bank Universal Health Coverage (UHC) progress report underscores a concerning reality. Over half of the global population lacks full access to quality health care and progress on UHC has stalled.",


            "Additionally, significant financial hardships prevail. In 2019, over 1 billion people faced catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending and nearly 17 percent of the global population was pushed into poverty due to healthcare costs.",


            "From climate to conflicts to finances, policy makers face an array of intertwined challenges. Government spending through 2028 is projected to contract or remain stagnant relative to 2019 in nearly two-thirds of all low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). At the same time, the priority of health in government spending has dropped close to or even below pre-COVID levels in most low-income and lower-middle-income countries.",


            "We need to rethink our approaches and strategies for ensuring population health. Strengthening health care in LMICs remains critical for unlocking human potential and fostering a healthier, more prosperous world.",

            "While primary care serves as the bedrock of a robust health care system by supporting prevention, early diagnosis, and ongoing management of common and chronic conditions, hospital-based care plays a pivotal role in ensuring access to acute and operative care, specialized interventions, and advanced treatments, as well as in preparing for and responding to emergencies.",


            "According to the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, in 2015, there were about 5 billion people across the globe who lacked access to safe, affordable and timely surgical and anesthesia care, including access to life-saving surgeries like emergency cesarean sections and appendicectomies. In LMICs, 9 in 10 people fell into this category. Without addressing the deficits in capacity and access to hospital care, progress on many important health indicators, like maternal mortality, will remain suboptimal.",

            
            "Despite this dire state of affairs, coupled with the fact that hospitals frequently consume a large percentage of the resources and personnel in a country’s health ecosystem, hospitals are often a side note in broader health discussions or they are considered in isolation.",


            "But from a patient’s perspective, what matters is whether they can get the care they need when and where they need it, at a price they can afford—and that the pieces of the system work together seamlessly to produce the best possible outcomes. As such, competition between hospitals and primary health care, whether perceived or real, hinders the holistic approach that is needed to plan national investment in health care. It also undermines workforce optimization and ultimately compromises the quality of patient experience in the quest for seamless, quality care.",


            "Hospitals—the services they provide, their infrastructure, expertise, and workforce—must be an integral part of a high-quality health system that addresses the health needs of the population. This requires a systems-based approach, placing primary health care and hospitals together within a broader health system framework."

            "Imagine stopping by your favorite grocery store only to find barren shelves and shockingly high prices. This scenario is not as unlikely as you might think. Global supply chains, largely unseen by ordinary consumers, work 24/7 across the globe to ensure that products are available at reasonable prices.",


            "These supply chains are more fragile than they might appear. Recent events have shown just how vulnerable international trade is to disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted maritime operations, causing delays and congestion that rippled through global supply chains. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has significantly impacted the global food supply, driving up food prices, reducing grain exports, and exacerbating food insecurity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where transport costs can account for up to 50% of food prices. More recently, attacks on shipping in the Gulf of Aden have disrupted critical maritime trade routes, resulting in increased shipping costs and delays.",


            "The potential impact goes far beyond your kitchen pantry. Supply chain disruptions can affect anything—electronics, automobiles, medical supplies, factory equipment, consumer goods, and more—and without warning. The resulting inventory shortages, operational inefficiencies, production delays, and increased costs can wreak havoc on economies, especially in developing countries.",


            "Nobody knows what threats will appear in the future. But we do know that container ports—the indispensable hubs of global commerce—can play a role in protecting global trade from unforeseen disruptions.",

            
            "Container ports are the lifelines of global trade, particularly for developing countries. Over 80% of international trade is transported via sea routes, with a substantial portion carried in containers. Efficient container ports reduce the cost and time associated with importing and exporting goods, making exports more competitive and lowering import prices. High-performing ports attract foreign investment, support local industries, create jobs, and boost income levels, fostering sustainable economic development.",


            "Building the resilience of ports requires reliable and consistent data. Accurate performance metrics can help governments and other stakeholders identify inefficiencies and target specific areas for improvement. Good data allows for informed decision-making, enabling ports to implement strategic interventions that boost resilience and efficiency. This approach ensures that investments in infrastructure, technology, and processes are directed where they are needed most, which helps protect global trade against unforeseen disruptions."

            "With global growth stabilizing for the first time in three years, inflation reaching a three-year low, and financial conditions brightening, the global economy seems to be on its final approach for a “soft landing.” But this positive news cannot obscure the grim reality: more than four years after the COVID-19 pandemic began, the world—especially developing economies—has yet to embark on a promising path toward prosperity.",


            "As a new World Bank Group report shows, the rate at which annual global growth is stabilizing—2.7 percent, on average, through 2026—is significantly lower than the 3.1 percent average in the pre-pandemic decade. That is insufficient to support progress on key development goals. By the end of this year, one in four developing economies will be poorer than they were on the eve of the pandemic. In 2024-2025, most of the world’s economies are set to grow more slowly than they did in the decade before COVID-19.",


            "With global interest rates expected to average 4 percent through 2026, double the level of the previous two decades, this outlook is unlikely to change. Rather than hope for a stroke of luck, governments should be working to advance long-term growth by fostering productivity, entrepreneurship, and innovation, in a setting of closer international cooperation.",


            "This is the model that flourished after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Encouraging the flow of goods, capital, and ideas across borders made possible roughly 25 years of unprecedented global prosperity, during which the gap between per capita income in the world’s poorest and richest countries narrowed significantly. Before the pandemic, an end to extreme poverty appeared to be within reach.",


            "But international cooperation has been fracturing in recent years. Measures designed to restrain cross-border commercial flows are proliferating.  With many major economies holding elections this year, uncertainty over trade policy is higher than at any other moment this century. These developments are taking place amid persistent weakness in investment: in 2013 to 2023, investment growth in developing economies fell to less than half the rate in the 2000s.",


            "This helps to explain why per capita income growth in developing economies is expected to average just 3 percent through 2026, well below the 3.8 percent average in the decade before COVID-19. Many developing economies will not make any progress at all in closing the income gap with their developed-economy counterparts in the near term, and that gap will widen for nearly half in the first five years of this decade—the highest share since the 1990s.",


            "But there are also bright spots in the global economy. The United States, in particular, has shown impressive resilience, with growth remaining buoyant even amid the most rapid monetary policy tightening in four decades. U.S. dynamism is a key reason why the global economy has some upside potential over the next two years.",


            "Among emerging markets, India and Indonesia stand out for their strong performance. Buoyed by vibrant domestic demand, surging investment, and a dynamic services sector, India’s economy is projected to grow by 6.7 percent per fiscal year, on average, through 2026. (South Asia is now the world’s fastest-growing region.) For its part, Indonesia is expected to grow by 5.1 percent, on average, over the next two years, thanks largely to a rising middle class and prudent economic policies.",


            "These economies prove that high growth rates can be sustained, even under difficult conditions. If others want to achieve similar success, and enhance their own long-term growth potential, they must enact policies that strengthen human capital, boost productivity, and encourage more women to enter the labor force. To this end, efficient and well-targeted public investment is critical.",


            "In developing economies, public investment accounts for just a quarter of total investment, on average. Our research shows that scaling it up by just 1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) can increase total GDP by more than 1.5 percent over the medium term and boost private investment by as much as 2 percent within roughly five years. The benefits are largest in countries with a track record of efficient public investment and, crucially, sufficient fiscal space to increase spending.",


            "For some countries, especially small developing countries with populations of less than 1.5 million, this is a formidable challenge. Home to just 17 million people, small developing countries face climate-related natural disasters at a rate that is eight times higher, on average, than in other developing economies. Making matters worse, two-fifths of these countries are in, or at high risk of, debt distress.",


            "But this does not mean that small-state governments cannot steer their economies onto a more stable, prosperous path. On the contrary, they have considerable room to mobilize more revenues from domestic sources, which offer a more reliable fiscal base than foreign flows. They can also create fiscal frameworks—including rainy-day funds—capable of coping with frequent natural disasters and other shocks, and improve the efficiency of public spending, especially on health, education, and infrastructure. International policy coordination and financial support can complement these efforts.",


            "Policymakers have good reason to celebrate: the world economy has avoided recession, despite the steepest rise in global interest rates since the 1980s. But they must also recognize that, in much of the world, growth remains too slow to support progress on development and poverty reduction. Without stronger international cooperation and policies that advance shared prosperity, the global economy will remain stuck in the slow lane."
